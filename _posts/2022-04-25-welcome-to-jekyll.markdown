Going on a vacation sounds so much fun. Planning a vacation; not so much. It's a bit of a stressful affair. And it becomes more so when you don’t know where to start and how to go about it.

There are certain things (read: tips) that you can do irrespective of the type of trip be it solo travelling, honeymoon or a vacation with kids. A few time-tested strategies will not only save you money but will bring peace of mind knowing that the trip for most part is not going haywire.
## Choose your destination and dates(wisely)
If your new year resolution is to visit your desktop’s wallpaper, it’s time you stop drooling about it and lock in the destination. If you do not have a wallpaper to drool over, think about what activities you enjoy doing or dream about.

Are you a beach person or do you enjoy getting lost in the mountains? Or maybe you want to soak yourself in ancient history. Take a pick. Then go to the internet and search for destinations based on your likings and preferences and pick one (or many).

But that’s not the end of it. What’s the point of going to Kashmir in April if your eyes were set on all the ‘snowfall in Kashmir’ videos. By the way, the best time to witness snowfall in Kashmir is December through January.

Select the dates/month which offers the best of the destination given your preferences and you move one step closer to your perfect vacation.
## Become an early planner
It’s never too early to start planning and booking for your favourite destination.

I booked my return flight from Mumbai to Switzerland for INR 22,000(approx. USD 300) since I booked 9 months in advance. The tickets otherwise skyrocket to INR 40,000(approx. USD 550) and beyond.

Same applies to booking hotels and other activities which offer a significant discount if booked early.
## Compare before booking
Comparing prices online has been saving money for travellers for at-least a decade now. There are a plethora of platforms, all trying to grab your attention by giving you the best deal. Benefit from this fierce competition and get the best deal for your flights/hotels/activities.

My all-time personal favourite is Skyscanner which aggregates the deals from all the airline/hotel partners and makes it easy to pick the best deal. It also lets you know cheaper flights/hotels if you are flexible with your dates. Needless to say, I have saved a good amount of money using Skyscanner. Thanks Bud!

When it comes to activities, I prefer Klook over others for their unbeatable prices and trust worthiness in the travel space. Again, compare the prices on other online platforms before you book.

## Buy travel insurance
Funny story:  Check in Baggage for my Mumbai to Geneva flight flew to Canada. It had my wife’s vanity bag, a few warm clothes among other stuff.

Travel insurance came to the rescue. We purchased a couple of necessary items after reaching Geneva and sent the bills to the insurance company to reimburse. The insurance company reimbursed for 80% of the purchase value. Not bad.

Fortunately, we received the baggage back after 5 days and the travel insurance covered a couple of our expenses until then.

**Lesson of the day:** ALWAYS buy travel insurance esp. when travelling internationally.

Make sure that your travel insurance provides at-least the below covers:
- Loss or delay of checked baggage

- Flight delays/cancellation

- Medical expenses/personal accident

- Loss of passport

- Emergency cash benefits in case of theft/burglary

- Trip cancellation

- Accidental death or disability

## Don’t get stuck in airport transit
Airport transit visa is a special type of visa that allows you to pass through an international airport without having to leave the airport. You’d use this when you have a connecting flight from another country.

My friend had his return flight from Amsterdam to Mumbai via London. He assumed that the Schengen Visa would fare him across London. Guess what, it didn’t. He ended up booking another flight at an 
exorbitant price. Don’t be that guy.

Call up the Airline, ask in travel forums such as Tripadvisor or r/travel reddit group etc. to confirm about the Transit Visa requirements. If you do need one, make the necessary arrangements well in advance.

It’s unimaginably painful to learn at the airport that you won’t be able to board the flight because of Transit Visa requirements so make sure you are completely aware of it.
 
## It’s not about every nook and corner
When you search for ‘Things to do in city’, you’d find hundreds of tourist attractions in a city. Practically speaking, you’d be able to cover only a few of the places during your stay of a few days.

And it is completely ok to visit only a few of them. Visit places which you know you'd enjoy touring. If you like beaches, go and enjoy the sunset and don’t worry about that museum that you know in your heart is not your kind of a place.

Vacation is not about checking all the tourist attractions off your checklist. You’d end up running one place after another like it’s a task. It shouldn’t be. You may be able to cover a lot of the attractions this way but ask yourself, did you have a good time or was everything a touch and go experience.
 
Having shared all these tips, you can only plan an almost perfect vacation. When on a trip, there will be surprise elements, things that you did not see coming.

Don’t worry, that’s a good thing because it makes the whole experience exciting and interesting. Knowing that you didn’t prepare for it and dealing with it on the fly. That’s life, right?
